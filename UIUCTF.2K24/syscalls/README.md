## TL;DR

I can execute a shellcode, but seccomp is enabled. Almost all dangerous syscalls for code execution/file read are disabled, except `Openat`, `preadv2`, `writev` (with some constraints).
Flag file path is given by our binary banner, and by Dockerfile, moreover.

Hence:
 - I open flag.txt with `Openat`, setting *dirfd* to -100, which forces our syscall to open our file from current directory.
 - I read our file in a *iovec array* with `preadv2`
 - Syscall `writev` is constrained, we can only write to file descriptors bigger than  *0x3e8*, making writing directly to *stdout* impossible.
 - Thus I duplicate our *stdout* to a big enough File Descriptor with `dup2` syscall and I print our *iovec* array to *stdout* using our duplicated File Descriptor.

## Solve

Let's explain it with a bit more details.

First thing I dump the seccomp rules.
```sh
> seccomp-tools dump ./syscalls
The flag is in a file named flag.txt located in the same directory as this binary. That's all the information I can give you.

 0024: 0x06 0x00 0x00 0x00000000  return KILL

```
I notice the following things:
- I can't execute sytem commands: `execve` and `execveat` syscalls are disabled. 
- I can open a file with `openat` syscall.
- I can read a file into a *iovec array* using `preadv2`
- `writev` syscall is allowed, but I can't write into File Descriptors lower than 0x3e8:
```sh
 0021: 0x20 0x00 0x00 0x00000010  A = fd # writev(fd, vec, vlen)
 0022: 0x25 0x00 0x01 0x000003e8  if (A <= 0x3e8) goto 0024
 0023: 0x06 0x00 0x00 0x7fff0000  return ALLOW
 0024: 0x06 0x00 0x00 0x00000000  return KILL
```
After that I check our binary protections, but we don't really need it since we can already execute a shellcode of our choice, but it's always a good practice so I do it anyway.

Then I execute our binary for a first insight.

```sh
 > ./syscalls                   
The flag is in a file named flag.txt located in the same directory as this binary. That's all the information I can give you.

```

Banner is pointing us out that our flag is stored into *flag.txt*. Then it reads an arbitrary shellcode and executes it.

Well let's start developing a strategy.

Opening *flag.txt* file is pretty trivial, `openat` syscall is not blacklisted. Never underestimate the power of `openat` and `execveat` syscalls.
Reading `openat` *man*'s description we learn that:

>If the pathname given in _pathname_ is relative, then it is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the file descriptor _dirfd_ (rather than relative to the current working directory of the calling process, as is done by **[open](https://linux.die.net/man/2/open)**(2) for a relative pathname).
>If _pathname_ is relative and _dirfd_ is the special value **AT_FDCWD**, then _pathname_ is interpreted relative to the current working directory of the calling process (like **[open](https://linux.die.net/man/2/open)**(2)).
>If _pathname_ is absolute, then _dirfd_ is ignored.

So I have two options, using an absolute pathname or setting *_dirfd_* to *AT_FDCWD*.
I'll use the latter for semplicity.

Once having our file opened, we must read our file into somewhere. Being impossible for us common mortals remembering all syscalls, I start skimming **[syscall.sh](https://x64.syscall.sh/)**.
So I find an interasting syscall which is not in *seccomp* blacklist: `preadv2`.

> **ssize_t readv(int** _fd_**, const struct iovec ***_iov_**, int** _iovcnt_**);**
> The **readv**() system call reads _iovcnt_ buffers from the file associated with the file descriptor _fd_ into the buffers described by _iov_ ("scatter input").
> The **writev**() system call writes _iovcnt_ buffers of data described by _iov_ to the file associated with the file descriptor _fd_ ("gather output").
> The pointer _iov_ points to an array of _iovec_ structures, defined in _<[sys/uio.h](https://linux.die.net/include/sys/uio.h)>_ as:
> struct iovec {
> void  *iov_base;    /* Starting address */
> size_t iov_len;     /* Number of bytes to transfer */
> }; 

Thus I create a *iovec struct* on stack and I read *flag.txt* into it.

Well now that I have *flag.txt* content in memory, it's time to print it out.

As our binary seccomp rules suggests I can use `writev`. But unluckily it's not so easy. Our destination File Descriptor must be greater than *0x3e8*, otherwise our program is brutally killed.

How can we do it? Thanks to `dup2` syscall! 
>#include <[unistd.h](https://linux.die.net/include/unistd.h)>
>int dup(int oldfd);int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);
>**dup2**() makes _newfd_ be the copy of _oldfd_, closing _newfd_ first if necessary, but note the following:
>If _oldfd_ is not a valid file descriptor, then the call fails, and _newfd_ is not closed.
>If _oldfd_ is a valid file descriptor, and _newfd_ has the same value as _oldfd_, then **dup2**() does nothing, and returns _newfd_.
>After a successful return from one of these system calls, the old and new file descriptors may be used interchangeably. They refer to the same open file description (see _**[open](https://linux.die.net/man/2/open)**(2)_) and thus share file offset and file status flags; for example, if the file offset is modified by using _**[lseek](https://linux.die.net/man/2/lseek)**(2)_ on one of the descriptors, the offset is also changed for the other.
>The two descriptors do not share file descriptor flags (the close-on-exec flag). The close-on-exec flag (**FD_CLOEXEC**; see _**[fcntl](https://linux.die.net/man/2/fcntl)**(2)_) for the duplicate descriptor is off.

So I duplicate *stdout* into a big enough File descriptor and we can finally print our flag out.


## Considerations
This challenge made me learn about `writev`s and `pread`s syscall. I think that it was an overall nice challenge.
